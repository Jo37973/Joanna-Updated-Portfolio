This app is geared towards CA residents, or anyone looking into more information about earthquakes in CA. 

 When loading the page, the user will be able to see a search bar with a city or zip code input, a map displaying live feed of earthquake activity in CA for the past two weeks, 10 of the most recent CA earthquakes, 10 earthquakes sorted by magnitude, and a widget for the USGS Facebook newsfeed. 

When the user enters a zip code or city, then they are presented with the 5 most recent earthquakes for that area that will be sorted by time and date.

 If there are no recent earthquakes, within a 100 mile radius of the searched area, then the user is given an alert that “No recent earthquakes have happened within 100 miles of your zip code.” 

After performing a zip code/city search, then the user is presented with a clickable link in the search history to return to those results, or can otherwise perform a new zip code search to find the recent ten earthquakes for that area.
